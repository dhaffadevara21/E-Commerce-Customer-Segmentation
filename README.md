### 3. Loyalty Tier Analysis

| Tier                | Satisfaction Trend   | Key Insight                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Gold**            | 100% satisfied       | Program is highly effective.             |
| **Silver & Bronze** | Majority unsatisfied | Need for improvement in perceived value. |

📈 *Enhancing lower-tier benefits can boost satisfaction and reduce churn.*

---

### 4. Purchase Frequency

* **Satisfied:** Buy every ~20–25 days → high loyalty
* **Neutral:** Buy every ~25–30 days → moderate potential
* **Unsatisfied:** Buy every ~40–60 days → high churn risk

⚠️ *Customers with long purchase gaps need targeted retention efforts.*
